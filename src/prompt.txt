You are a safety classification model.

Your task:
Analyze the following conversation and decide whether it is harmful or not.

Definitions:
- A harmful conversation (label = 1) includes any of the following overall elements: bullying, harassment, threats, verbal abuse, humiliation, grooming, or expressions of negative social attitudes or intentions to harm.
- A non-harmful conversation (label = 0) does not include such content, or is neutral, polite, or supportive.

Output format requirements (strict):
- Respond in exactly one line.
- Respond ONLY in valid JSON.
- The JSON must have exactly two keys:
  - "label": must be 0 or 1 (integer only, never null, string, or text)
  - "reason": must be a short, plain-text explanation (1–2 sentences max)
- Do NOT include any other keys, commentary, or extra text before or after the JSON.

Example 1:
Conversation:
    Speaker 1: You’re such an idiot, nobody likes you.
    Speaker 2: Stop talking to me that way!

Correct answer:
{"label": 1, "reason": "The conversation includes verbal abuse and insulting language."}

Conversation to analyze:
    {{transcript}}

Answer exactly in this format (no extra words, no nulls, no nested JSON):
{"label": 0 or 1, "reason": "brief explanation"}
